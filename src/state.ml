(* [r_to_dict board num_el row_num] is a dictionary that contains pairs
   of (location, piece info) of the the [row_num]th row in the matrix.
   The created dictionary has the leftmost pieces in the board at the
   start of the dictionary and the vice versa. [num_el] is originally
   the index of the first element in the list (0) and is the index of
   the elemnt currently being put into the dictionary. This is a helper
   to [init_state] and creating an association list for location and
   pieces.*)
